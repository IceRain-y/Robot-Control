# Robot-Control
This repository mainly comprises various types of robot mechanical configuration designs, kinematic and dynamic modeling, relevant controller designs and their parameter tuning, optimal control algorithm designs, as well as debugging of physical prototypes. There are two main technology stacks adopted: the first is the MBD development approach using Matlab-Simulink, with the Simscape library utilized for adding physical characteristics to the dynamic components; the second is the ROS-C++ development method, leveraging the native features and frameworks of ROS for robot development. Further content will be continuously added.
